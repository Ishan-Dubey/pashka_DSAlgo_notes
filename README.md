# Algorithms and Data Structures Notes

Pavel Mavrin ([pashka](https://codeforces.com/profile/pashka) on 
Codeforces) teaches an algorithms and data structures course at ITMO 
University, and is streaming lectures on Twitch and uploading on 
Youtube.

More information [here](https://codeforces.com/blog/entry/82217).

This repository contains **unofficial** notes I made for reference 
while following along the lectures. All of the Home Tasks are unchanged 
PDFs shared by him on his [Codeforces 
blog](https://codeforces.com/blog/pashka).
